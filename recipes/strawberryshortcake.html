        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch cake pan with butter and lightly dust with flour.</li>
            <li>Slice the strawberries and toss them with 1/3 cup of white sugar. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, 1/4 cup of white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl; cut in butter with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of mixture; add beaten egg, half-and-half, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Stir mixture until just combined and no dry spots remain, being careful not to overmix.</li>
            <li>Spoon batter evenly into prepared cake pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean and top is golden brown, about 18 minutes. Let cool partially in cake pan, about 10 minutes. Flip cake onto a clean work surface. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, beat heavy cream, powdered sugar, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Set aside.</li>
